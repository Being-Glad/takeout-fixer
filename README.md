Takeout Date Fixer

Restoring order to your digital life.

When you export photos from Google Takeout, all your original "Date Taken" metadata is stripped from the files and put into separate .json files. This leaves your photo library in a complete mess.

Takeout Date Fixer is a free, open-source tool that reads those JSON files and puts the correct date, GPS location, and descriptions back into your photos and videos permanently.

Frequently Asked Questions

Why do I need this?
When you download from Google Takeout, Google separates the metadata (date, location) into JSON files. This tool reads them and puts the correct info back, so your photos don't all show today's date.

Is it safe?
Yes. Both the web and desktop versions process your files 100% locally on your device. Your photos never leave your computer.

What's the difference between Web and Desktop?
The Quick-Fix (Web) app is for small batches (<5GB) and only fixes the file sorting date. The Desktop App has unlimited size and permanently writes true EXIF/GPS data.

Why is it free?
We believe you shouldn't have to pay to get your own data back in a usable format. This project is free and open-source. If you find it useful, you can support its development here.
