---

When you export photos from Google Takeout, all your original "Date Taken" metadata is stripped from the files and put into separate `.json` files. This leaves your photo library in a complete mess, with every photo dated on the day you downloaded it.

Takeout Date Fixer is a free, open-source tool that reads those JSON files and puts the correct date, GPS location, and descriptions back into your photos and videos permanently.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Quick-Fix (Web) | Desktop App (Pro) |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Fix Sort Order** ("Date Modified") | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Write Permanent EXIF Metadata** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Restore GPS Location** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Restore Captions/Descriptions** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **File Size Limit** | 5GB | Unlimited |
| **Runs Offline** | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🚀 Two Ways to Fix

### 1. Quick-Fix (Web App)
For quick jobs on the go. No installation required.
> **➡️ Launch the Web App**

Perfect for small batches under 5GB. It fixes the "Date Modified" so your files sort correctly in your file explorer.

### 2. Desktop App (Pro)
For unlimited power and permanent fixes.

The desktop app writes the original date, GPS, and descriptions directly into the file's permanent EXIF metadata. This is the recommended solution for archiving your library or importing it into apps like Apple Photos, Adobe Lightroom, or Plex.

## 💻 Downloads

The Desktop App is 100% free, open-source, and runs entirely offline.

## 🤔 Frequently Asked Questions

**Why do I need this?**
> When you download from Google Takeout, Google separates the metadata (date, location) into JSON files. This tool reads them and puts the correct info back, so your photos don't all show today's date.

**Is it safe?**
> Yes. Both the web and desktop versions process your files 100% locally on your device. Your photos never leave your computer. The code is fully open-source for transparency.

**What's the difference between the Web and Desktop apps?**
> The **Quick-Fix (Web)** app is for small batches (<5GB) and only fixes file sorting dates. The **Desktop App** has no size limit and permanently writes true EXIF/GPS data into the files themselves.

**Why is it free?**
> We believe you shouldn't have to pay to get your own data back in a usable format. This project is free and open-source forever.
