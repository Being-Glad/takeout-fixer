Takeout Metadata Fixer

This project provides two free, open-source tools to fix your Google Takeout photo and video metadata.

Browser Version (Live Demo): A simple browser-based app for small jobs (< 5GB).

Desktop App (Recommended): A powerful "pro" app for all users. It has no size limit and permanently writes EXIF, GPS, and Title data.

This is a 100% free, open-source alternative to paid apps like metadatafixer.com.

1. Free Desktop App (Recommended)

This is the full-power version, recommended for all users. It's faster, more powerful, and fixes your files permanently. It now works out-of-the-box with no extra setup.

How to Use the Desktop App

Open the "Takeout Metadata Fixer" app.

Drag and drop any number of your Google Takeout files or folders onto the window.

Click the big green "Fix Metadata" button.

Wait for the processing to finish.

Your files are now fixed, in-place. You can import them into Apple Photos, Google Photos, or any other library, and they will sort perfectly.

2. Browser Version (for quick jobs)

Live at: https://Being-Glad.github.io/takeout-fixer/

This is a simple browser app. It's fast and easy, but has limitations:

5GB Limit: Browsers crash with large folders.

No EXIF Writing: It only fixes the file's "Modified Date" inside a .zip file. It cannot write the real "Date Taken" or GPS data.
